# syllabus_to_html
Python script that converts a syllabus from a Saylor.org site to separate HTML files per unit, and also convert them to markdown.

Put this script in the same folder as a syllabus file you downloaded from Saylor.org.
  (example: http://www.saylor.org/site/syllabus.php?cid=262)
  
This script will create a new folder and put the course's introduction and each of its units in that folder, as both HTML and Markdown-formatted documents.
